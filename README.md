# UCP-Hunter
This is a custom bash script that automates the testing process for unauthenticated cache purge vulnerability for a list of target domains or subdomains. The list of domains is taken from a text file and those targets which are vulnerable will be printed out to the console.

Usage - 
1. git clone https://github.com/omnigodz/UCP-Hunter.git
2. cd UCP-Hunter
3. chmod +x ucp-hunter.sh
4. ./ucp-hunter.sh filename (where file name is the text file that consists of the target domains or subdomains)
